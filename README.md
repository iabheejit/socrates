# AI-Powered Socratic Teaching Assistant for Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This project implements an innovative AI-powered teaching assistant designed to guide students through the intricacies of Data Structures and Algorithms using the Socratic method. By leveraging advanced natural language processing and a dynamic course generation system, this assistant provides a personalized, interactive learning experience that adapts to each student's pace and understanding.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Course Generation**: Customizes course content for Data Structures and Algorithms topics.
- **Interactive WhatsApp Interface**: Engages students through a familiar messaging platform.
- **Socratic Dialogue System**: Asks probing questions to lead students to deeper understanding.
- **Adaptive Learning Path**: Adjusts content and questions based on student responses.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors student advancement through Airtable integration.
- **Completion Certification**: Generates certificates upon course completion.

## Components

1. **OpenAI Integration** (`OpenAI.js`)
   - Utilizes GPT-4 for content generation and Socratic interactions.

2. **WhatsApp Communication** (`wati.js`)
   - Manages messaging interface for student interaction.

3. **Course Content Engine** (`index.js`)
   - Generates tailored course material on specified topics.

4. **Student Data Management** (`airtable_methods.js`)
   - Tracks student progress and stores course-related data.

5. **Learning Flow Controller** (`server.js`, `test.js`)
   - Orchestrates the learning experience, including module delivery and question handling.

6. **Certificate Generator** (`certificate.js`)
   - Creates personalized completion certificates.

## How It Works

1. The system generates a customized course outline for Data Structures and Algorithms.
2. Students interact with the assistant via WhatsApp, receiving course content in digestible modules.
3. For each topic, the assistant engages the student in a Socratic dialogue, asking probing questions to guide understanding.
4. Based on student responses, the system adapts its questioning strategy and content delivery.
5. Student progress is continuously tracked, allowing for personalized pacing and review.
6. Upon completion, students receive a generated certificate of achievement.

## Benefits

- **Scalable One-on-One Learning**: Provides personalized attention to multiple students simultaneously.
- **Consistent Quality**: Maintains a high standard of Socratic questioning across all interactions.
- **24/7 Availability**: Allows students to learn at their own pace and preferred times.
- **Adaptive Content**: Tailors the learning experience to individual student needs and progress.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Offers real-time guidance and clarification on complex topics.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of code execution and analysis for hands-on algorithm practice.
- Enhanced natural language processing for more nuanced understanding of student responses.
- Expanded topic coverage within Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Implementation of peer-to-peer learning features to foster collaborative problem-solving.
